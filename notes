#turn on a dataframe from the .csv file
#view the dataframe
#filter the dataframe using the "airline sentiment" and "text" columns
#plot a histogram to see the data (of the sentiment)
#map the labels to integers (1,0) by creating a dictionary which maps "positive" to 1 and "negative" to "0" and call the map function to add it to df?
#call the head function again to view the changes
#check the length of df
#grab the text column and turn it into a list (make it into a variable "text")
#run the classifier on the text
